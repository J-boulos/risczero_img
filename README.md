# Implementation of verifiable image transformations in risczero

## Repository contents : 
- Source code for both imgTransformations and composition modules.
- PDF slides that explain Risc Zero's architecture, the types of claims that can be proven using these programs, as well as my methodology and approach.
- A demo directory that automates the build process. It also contains bash scripts that mimic some of the achievable workflows.(more on that in demo/READMDE.md)

## I might maintain this repo in the future by adding :
- more transformations  
- trying to find an efficient way of handling reconstruction of img chunks that result from non-local pixel transformations
- optimizing the guest code after profiling
